## Search Bar Support

To reduce typing aka.ms/ all the time you can add a prefix to make it super quick to get to the aka.ms links.

Once set up all you have to do is 
* Open a new tab
* Type **a** and press **SPACE** or **TAB** 
* Type in the aka.ms shortcut. eg. **ad/users**

![Search bar demo](/images/SearchBarDemo.gif)

### Microsoft Edge

* Go to **Settings** > **Privacy, Search and Services** > Scroll all the way down to **Services**
* Select **Address bar and search** > **Manage search engines**
* Select **Add**
* Fill in the following
  * Search engine: **aka.ms**
  * Shortcut: **a** (You can choose any prefix you like)
  * Url: **https://aka.ms/%s**
* Select **Add**

A quick alternative to get to the **Manage search enginess** page is to search for **Manage search engines** under **Settings** and select **Address bar search**

### Google Chrome

* Scroll down to **Site Search**
* Select **Add**
* Fill in the following
  * Search engine: **aka.ms**
  * Shortcut: **a** (You can choose any prefix you like)
  * Url: **https://aka.ms/%s**
* Select **Add**

### Firefox

Unfortunately [Firefox does not have an easy way to do add a search engine](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1683969) and an extension may be required. If you find an easy way please share.
